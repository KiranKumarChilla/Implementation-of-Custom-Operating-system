# Implementation-of-Custom-Operating-system
An Individual project where I designed a basic virtual operating system using Java where jobs are loaded from file to disk(drive).Few Jobs(as per available memory) are then loaded from disk to Memory . since it is sequential , jobs are stored in ready queue and operations are performed in FIFO process.Ready queue is dynamically updated with new jobs when one job enters memory. Paging is used in storing data. Memory is released as soon as the job executes.
Input to the system will be in Hex format.
